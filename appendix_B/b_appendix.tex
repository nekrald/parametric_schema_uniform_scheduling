% Computational Approach
\section*{Appendix B. Computational Approach}

Since we do not have explicit formula for $B$, it is natural to find some computational approach. 
Then it is useful to propose an algorithm searching for the optimal $B$ 
with given $m, k, s$.
For example, we can try the following (approximation) algorithm to find worst-case performance $\hat{B} \geq B^{opt}$:

\subsection*{Algorithm with a grid search for $\varphi$}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep = -1mm, leftmargin = *]

    \item Binary Search over $B$. Really, monotonous properties hold. As an upper bound we can take the Cho-Sahni result for the general case.

    \item Assume from now that $B$ is fixed. Check each $\varphi$ over a grid on the interval $[0, 1]$.

    \item Assume from now that $\varphi$ is fixed. Do binary search over $R$ for the third inequality from \eqref{scheme}.

    \item Here we assume that $R$ is fixed. Perform conditions check. Note that $z$ is obtained explicitly from $s$.

\end{enumerate}

Another option is to consider all possible $R$, then we do not need to do the 
grid search for $\varphi$. 

\subsection*{Optimization algorithm with iterating through the number of groups $R$}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep = -1mm, leftmargin = *]
    \item Binary search over $B$ as in previous algorithm.

    \item Assume from now that $B$ is fixed. Do the following step for each $R$.

    \item The first inequality in \eqref{scheme} gives linear constraint 
        for $\varphi$. The third inequality in \eqref{scheme} is solved 
        by binary search over $\varphi$.

\end{enumerate}


From Property \ref{property-increase-m} it follows that  for fixed $s, k$ and running $m$ from 1 to infinity we may use the optimal result for
$m - 1$ as an upper bound for $B$, if the properties \ref{property-increase-m} hold.


\subsection*{Computation Results}


Here we present a plot of scheme quality for some parameters, and compare our results to the Cho-Sahni results.

        \includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{{./include/speed=1.5-fast=9}.png}

Levels plot for the difference in worst-case performance between our scheme and Cho-Sahni result.

The table below illustrates performance of the scheme presented in the paper depending on the number of fast and normal machines when $s = 2$.
